## The Quintessence of Rum Cocktails

The **Daiquiri** is a cocktail that epitomizes the simplicity of classic mixology, combining rum, lime, and sugar to create a refreshing and balanced drink.

## A Cuban Classic

The Daiquiri's story begins in the small village of Daiquirí, located just 14 miles east of Santiago de Cuba. It was here that an American engineer named **Jennings Stockton Cox** is said to have created the beverage after the American-Spanish War, while he was assigned to iron mines nearby the settlement.

## The Evolution of the Daiquiri

Originally served in a tall glass packed with cracked ice, the Daiquiri evolved to be mixed in a shaker with shaved ice, strained into a chilled coupe glass². The drink remained a local specialty until **Rear Admiral Lucius W. Johnson** introduced it to the Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C., after which its popularity soared².

## The Hemingway Connection

The Daiquiri was one of the favorite drinks of writer **Ernest Hemingway** and U.S. President **John F. Kennedy**. Its popularity in the U.S. surged in the 1940s when rum was more accessible than whiskey or vodka due to trade relations with Latin America and the Caribbean².

## Modern Daiquiri

Today, the Daiquiri is celebrated for its versatility and has spawned numerous variations, including fruit-flavored versions like the Strawberry Daiquiri. However, the classic Daiquiri remains a testament to the power of simplicity in cocktail making.
