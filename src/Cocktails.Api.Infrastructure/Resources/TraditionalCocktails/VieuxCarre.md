## Origin

Walter Bergeron, a bartender at New Orleans' legendary Carousel Bar (then known as the Swan Room) inside the Hotel Monteleone, first stirred the Vieux Carré to life during the 1930s. The cocktail remains a specialty of the establishment, and sipping one at the Monteleone's revolving Carousel Bar is an unforgettable experience.

## History

The Vieux Carré recipe was first printed in the 1937 edition of "Famous New Orleans Drinks and How to Mix 'Em." While it enjoyed initial popularity, it eventually fell into relative obscurity. However, with the recent resurgence of classic cocktails and the revitalization of fine rye whiskey, the Vieux Carré has once again taken its rightful place among the great drinks.

## Conclusion

The Vieux Carré is more than a cocktail; it's a sip of New Orleans' storied past. As you raise your glass, imagine the lively streets, jazz notes, and the timeless allure of the French Quarter. Cheers to the Vieux Carré—a drink that bridges eras and flavors!
