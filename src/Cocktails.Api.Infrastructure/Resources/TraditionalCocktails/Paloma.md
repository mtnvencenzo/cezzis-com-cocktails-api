## Origins

The exact origin of the Paloma remains a bit hazy, but it likely emerged in the **1950s**. One story attributes its creation to **Don Javier Delgado Corona**, the owner and bartender of **La Capilla** in **Tequila, Mexico**. However, no specific establishment or bartender can be definitively credited with inventing this beloved cocktail⁶.

## The Dove Connection

The name "Paloma" translates to "dove" in Spanish. Some believe it refers to the bird, while others suspect it's derived from the word "pomelo," which means "grapefruit" in Spanish. Regardless, the Paloma's character is easy to love immediately—refreshing, citrusy, and perfect for warm days.

## Variations

While the classic Paloma sticks to the basic recipe, variations have emerged over time: 

**Fresh Juice**: Some versions use fresh white or red grapefruit juice instead of soda.  

**Sparkling Water**: Instead of soda, some bartenders top off the cocktail with sparkling water.  

**Cantarito**: A more complex variant, the cantarito includes lemon juice and orange juice in addition to lime juice.   

**Creative Twists**: In both the U.S. and Mexico, mixologists experiment with additional ingredients like agave syrup, salt, and liqueurs.

## Conclusion

Whether you're sipping a traditional Paloma with Squirt or trying a modern twist, this cocktail embodies the relaxed spirit of Mexico. So raise your glass to simplicity, friendship, and the joy of a well-made drink! 🥂🕊️🍹
