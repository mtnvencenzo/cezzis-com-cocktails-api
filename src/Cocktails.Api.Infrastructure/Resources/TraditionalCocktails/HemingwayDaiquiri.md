## Historical Context

The Hemingway Daiquiri was created in the 1930s at the famous El Floridita bar in Havana, Cuba³. Ernest Hemingway, known for his love of cocktails, frequented this bar during his time in Havana. The original Daiquiri, made with rum, lime, and sugar, was a favorite of Hemingway's, but he preferred his drinks less sweet and more robust¹.

According to legend, Hemingway once walked into El Floridita and tried a Daiquiri prepared by the bartender. He suggested cutting the sugar and doubling the rum, leading to the creation of the Papa Doble². This recipe, with its significant amount of rum and absence of sugar, became Hemingway's signature drink at the bar.

## Modern Interpretation

While the original Hemingway Daiquiri was quite tart, modern versions often include a small amount of simple syrup to balance the sourness⁶. The addition of grapefruit juice and maraschino liqueur gives the drink a unique depth and sweetness that contrasts with the sharpness of the lime.

Enjoy your Hemingway Daiquiri, a cocktail that captures the spirit of its namesake's adventurous and bold nature. 🍸📚
