## A New York Legend

The **Adonis cocktail**, with its intriguing blend of vermouth and sherry, carries the echoes of a bygone era—a time when New York City was bustling with creativity, music, and art.

## The Birthplace: The Old Absinthe House

In **1874**, at the **Old Absinthe House** in New York City, bartender **Cayetano Ferrer** crafted the Adonis cocktail. This historic establishment, nestled in the heart of the city, was a haven for artists, writers, and bon vivants. Imagine the dimly lit bar, the clinking of glasses, and the whispers of famous guests.

## Hollywood Connections: A Broadway Musical

While the Adonis cocktail has its roots in New York, it transcended geographical boundaries. In **1904**, the Broadway musical *It Happened in Nordland* featured a song titled "Absinthe Frappé." The lyrics celebrated the drink's icy allure and its ability to free one from life's burdens. Although the song emerged from New York, the concoction itself was born in the Crescent City.

## The Recipe: Vermouth and Sherry

The classic Adonis cocktail recipe calls for a harmonious blend of two-thirds **Italian sweet vermouth** to one-third **sherry**, along with two dashes of orange bitters. Bartenders expertly mixed these components, resulting in a libation that embodied sophistication and depth.

## The Prohibition Era: Adaptation and Resilience

In **1912**, the United States banned the sale of **absinthe**, fearing its alleged hallucinogenic effects. Bartenders substituted **Pernod** and **Herbsaint** for the real thing. The Adonis cocktail adapted, showcasing its resilience and enduring appeal.

## The Revival: A Taste of History

In a twist of fate, absinthe turned out to be less dangerous than feared. In **2007**, the ban was lifted in the United States, and many bars returned to serving the authentic spirit. Today, the Adonis cocktail lives on, inviting both locals and visitors to experience a taste of history.

Whether you're in New York or mixing it at home, raise your glass to the Adonis—a timeless libation that bridges eras and continents. 🥃🌿
