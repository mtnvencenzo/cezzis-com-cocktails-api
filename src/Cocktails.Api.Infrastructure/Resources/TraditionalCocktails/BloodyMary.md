## A Brunch Classic with a Spicy Kick

The name "Bloody Mary" is as enigmatic as the drink itself, with several theories about its origin. The cocktail has spawned many variants, including the **Red Snapper**, **Bloody Maria** (made with tequila), and the non-alcoholic **Virgin Mary**.

## A Tale of Two Cities: Paris and New York
The Bloody Mary is a cocktail that has stirred up as much debate about its origins as it has delighted taste buds. The drink's history is a tale of two cities: Paris and New York.

- **Paris in the 1920s**: The French bartender **Fernand Petiot** claimed to have invented the Bloody Mary in 1921 while working at the New York Bar in Paris, which later became the famous Harry's New York Bar.
- **New York's 21 Club**: There are also claims that the Bloody Mary was invented in the 1930s by bartender Henry Zbikiewicz or the comedian George Jessel, both of whom frequented the 21 Club in New York.

## A Morning Ritual and Hangover Cure
In the United States, the Bloody Mary has become synonymous with morning and early afternoon drinking, often touted as a hangover cure. Its rich, spicy, and umami flavors make it a popular choice for brunches and a staple in American cocktail culture.

Enjoy your Bloody Mary, a cocktail that's as much a part of culinary folklore as it is a beloved libation! 🍅🍸
