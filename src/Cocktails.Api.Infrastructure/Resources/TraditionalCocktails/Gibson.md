## A Muddled History

The Gibson's history is as intriguing as the drink itself, with several theories about its creation. One popular tale suggests that it was named after American illustrator Charles Dana Gibson, known for his "Gibson Girl" illustrations¹. Another story credits a San Francisco businessman, Walter D.K. Gibson, with creating the drink at the Bohemian Club in the late 1800s¹. Yet another version involves an American diplomat who, during Prohibition, would distinguish his non-alcoholic drink with a small onion garnish¹.

Despite these varied tales, the Gibson first appeared in print in the 1908 book, "The World's Drinks And How To Mix Them" by William Boothby, marking its place in cocktail history⁴.

## The Gibson Today

In modern times, the Gibson is celebrated for its elegance and simplicity. It's a variation of the gin martini, differentiated primarily by its garnish: a pickled onion². This subtle change from the martini's traditional olive or lemon twist imparts a distinct savory flavor profile that has captivated many.

## In Conclusion

Whether you're a gin aficionado or a newcomer to the world of cocktails, the Gibson offers a unique taste experience. Its understated complexity and rich backstory make it a timeless choice for any occasion²³.
