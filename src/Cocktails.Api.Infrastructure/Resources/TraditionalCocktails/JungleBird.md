## **Historical Origins**

The Jungle Bird cocktail has an intriguing backstory. It was created in the 1970s at the **Kuala Lumpur Hilton** in Malaysia, specifically at the hotel's **Aviary Bar**. The name "Jungle Bird" is fitting, as guests could observe tropical birds kept in a netted area near the swimming pool through a glass panel in the bar³. The cocktail was originally served in a **ceramic bird-shaped vessel**, sipped from an opening in the tail. Later, due to thefts of the original vessel, it was presented in a stemmed wine goblet engraved with a bird on the side³.

## **Modern-Day Popularity**

The Jungle Bird has experienced a resurgence in recent years, appearing on menus of trendy cocktail bars.
