## Origin

The exact origin of the Southside is shrouded in cocktail lore, but its roots likely stretch back to the early 20th century. Some say it emerged in the South Side neighborhood of Chicago, while others credit the Southside Sportsmen's Club on Long Island. Regardless, this cocktail has stood the test of time, gracing the menus of bars and clubs across the globe.

## History

**The 21 Club**: The 21 Club in New York City played a significant role in popularizing the Southside. Although the bar didn't open until 1922, it poured countless Southsides throughout the decades. While it may not have invented the drink, it certainly made it famous.

**Citrus Kerfuffle**: Southside recipes today vary between lemon and lime. Some bartenders use both. The 21 Club served theirs with lemon, and so does this recipe. The choice is yours—both versions are delightful.

## Conclusion

The Southside is more than a cocktail; it's a nod to history, a sip of timeless elegance. As you raise your glass, imagine the clink of flapper pearls, the jazz notes in the air, and the camaraderie of fellow imbibers. Cheers to the Southside—a minty masterpiece!
