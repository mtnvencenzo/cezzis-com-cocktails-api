## A Timeless Elegance
The Champagne Cocktail is one of the oldest cocktails, with roots dating back to at least the mid-1800s. Its creation is attributed to bartenders seeking to enhance the luxurious experience of sipping champagne.

## Tips for Perfection
To create the perfect Champagne Cocktail:

- Use a well-chilled, clean glass straight from the freezer. A flute provides a better drinking experience, while a saucer looks more decadent.
- Don't crush the cube; let it dissolve slowly to create bubbles. A rustic brown sugar cube adds character.
- Place a small napkin (bevnap) over the glass, put the soaked cube on top, and dash the bitters. The napkin absorbs excess bitters and guides the cube into the glass.

## Enduring Popularity
Despite its simplicity, the Champagne Cocktail remains popular. It's a celebration in a glass, combining bubbles, sweetness, and a touch of sophistication. Whether you're toasting a special occasion or simply indulging, this classic cocktail never goes out of style.

Cheers to the timeless elegance of the Champagne Cocktail! 🥂🍾
