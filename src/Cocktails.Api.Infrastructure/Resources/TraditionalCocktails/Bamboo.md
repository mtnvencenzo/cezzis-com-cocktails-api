## A Zen Elixir

The **Bamboo cocktail**—a fluid Zen kōan—balances simplicity and intricacy, ethereal yet intoxicating. Blending sherry and vermouth, this entrancing libation teaches us that the road to happiness need not be paved with distillate. Like bamboo itself, which bends under winter snow only to stand upright in spring, the Bamboo Cocktail adapts.

## The Arrival in Japan

When **Commodore Perry** sailed his warships into Tokyo Bay in **1854**, cocktails were surely the last thing on startled Japanese minds. Japan had been isolated, with its sole point of contact being the trading entrepôt of **Dejima**—a tiny island inhabited exclusively by Dutchmen. But the arrival of the **US Navy** shook things up, and a cocktail or two got sunk in the process.

## Louis Eppinger's Creation

**Louis Eppinger**, a German-born bartender contemporary to Jerry Thomas and William "Cocktail Bill" Boothby, found himself in Yokohama in **1889**. At **The Grand Hotel**, he introduced the Bamboo Cocktail as a house specialty. Easy-drinking yet flavorsome, Eppinger's creation softens the chiseled astringency of sherry with vermouth's lightly sweet aromatics.

## The Japanese Embrace

The Bamboo Cocktail remains a mainstay of Japanese bars, little known outside its native land. While not exactly fashionable, it enjoys excellent health in Japan despite vanishing from America. The Japanese stick closely to the traditional formula, while others experiment and generally sweeten the drink.

## The Enlightened Sip

Whether you're in a Tokyo bar or your own contemplative space, raise your glass to the Bamboo—a sip that whispers ancient wisdom and embraces the present moment. 🎋🥃
