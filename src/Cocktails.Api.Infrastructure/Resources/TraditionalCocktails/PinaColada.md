## Origins

The Piña Colada's history is rooted in **Puerto Rico** in the **1950s**. The most widely accepted story is that of bartender **Ramón "Monchito" Marrero Perez**, who created the drink in **1954** while working at the **Caribe Hilton Hotel** in San Juan¹. Initially, it was a non-alcoholic mix of coconut cream and pineapple juice, but when blenders became available on the island, rum was added, and the Piña Colada as we know it was born².

### Alternative Claims

Two other Puerto Rican bartenders, **Ricardo Garcia** and **Ramón Portas Mingot**, also claim to have invented the iconic drink. Mingot declared he created it in **1963** at the **Barrachina Restaurant** in San Juan. However, there's no conclusive evidence to support these claims¹.

## Puerto Rico's National Drink

In **1978**, the government of Puerto Rico officially declared the Piña Colada the national drink, celebrating its widespread popularity both within the country and abroad¹.

## In Popular Culture

The Piña Colada gained worldwide fame partly due to **Rupert Holmes'** song "Escape (The Piña Colada Song)" in **1979**. The catchy tune and its lyrics about finding love and enjoying Piña Coladas helped cement the cocktail's image as a symbol of relaxation and enjoyment.

Whether you're lounging on a sunny beach or just dreaming of one, a Piña Colada is the perfect way to bring a little bit of tropical paradise into your day. So, grab your blender, mix up this delightful concoction, and let every sip transport you to the sandy shores of Puerto Rico! 🍍🥥🍹
