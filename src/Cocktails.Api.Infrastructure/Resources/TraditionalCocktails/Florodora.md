## A Broadway-Inspired Refreshment

The **Florodora** is a delightful cocktail that has a storied history and a vibrant, refreshing taste. Here's a look into its background and how to make this classic drink:

## Theatrical Origins

The Florodora cocktail was named after the early 1900s Broadway musical comedy "Florodora." The show was a hit, and the cocktail became a favorite among New York's high society, maintaining its popularity up through the 1950s¹. The musical featured the "Florodora Sextette," a group of six beautiful women, and the cocktail's pink hue matched the aesthetics of the dancers²³.

## A Semisweet Sensation

The Florodora is a semisweet, tall, and beautifully pink cocktail that's both refreshing and easy to enjoy. It's a fabulous gin drink that balances the tartness of lime, the sweetness and fruit of raspberry syrup, and the spicy-sweet flavors of ginger beer².

Enjoy your Florodora, a cocktail that's as fun and lively as the musical that inspired it! 🍹🎭
