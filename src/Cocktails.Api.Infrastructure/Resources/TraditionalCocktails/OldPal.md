## Origins

The Old Pal's story begins with **Harry MacElhone**, an Irish bartender who tended bar in New York before returning to Europe during World War I. In **1922**, he took over the **New York Bar** in Paris, renaming it **Harry's New York Bar**. This iconic establishment hosted famous guests like **Ernest Hemingway** and **Coco Chanel**¹.

## The First Appearance

MacElhone published his cocktail recipes in the book **"Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails"** in **1919**. While some attribute the Old Pal's first appearance to the **1922 edition** of this book, there's a twist. The 2011 edition includes the Old Pal, crediting a sports writer named **"Sparrow" Robinson** for the drink. Robinson was known for calling everyone he met "old pal" and supposedly invented the cocktail in **1929**¹.

## The Mystery

The Old Pal's history is shrouded in mystery. Was it French (dry) or "Eyetalian" (sweet) vermouth? Did it originate in **1922**, **1927**, or even **1878**? And was it Sparrow's invention or MacElhone's dedication? The answers remain elusive, but the Old Pal endures as a testament to camaraderie and good spirits.

## Similar to the Boulevardier

The Old Pal shares similarities with the **Boulevardier**, which also appeared in MacElhone's writings. Both cocktails feature Italian vermouth initially, but the Old Pal now uses French vermouth (dry). While the Old Pal sticks to equal parts, the Boulevardier often has more whiskey.

So raise your glass to friendship, whiskey, and the enduring allure of the Old Pal! 🥃👴🏻🤝
