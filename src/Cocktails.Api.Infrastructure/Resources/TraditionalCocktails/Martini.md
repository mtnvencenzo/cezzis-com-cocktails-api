## Historical Stirrings

The Martini's history is as intriguing as the drink itself. One theory suggests that it evolved from a cocktail called the Martinez, served at the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco in the early 1860s¹. Another story claims that a bartender in the town of Martinez, California, created the drink³. Yet another possibility is that the name derives from the Italian Martini brand of vermouth¹.

## Crafting the Classic Martini

The classic Martini reached its most recognizable form by 1922, where London dry gin and dry vermouth were combined at a ratio of 2:1, stirred with ice, and then strained into a chilled cocktail glass¹. Over time, the amount of vermouth has steadily dropped, with ratios during the 1930s at 3:1 and during the 1940s at 4:1. By the latter part of the 20th century, 5:1 or even 6:1 dry Martinis became the norm¹.

## Modern Variations

Today, the Martini is often made "extra dry," with little to no vermouth. Some prefer it shaken, not stirred, and others enjoy it with a twist of lemon instead of an olive. The Vodka Martini uses vodka in place of gin and has also become a popular variation¹.
