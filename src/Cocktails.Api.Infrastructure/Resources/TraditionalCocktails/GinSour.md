## Historical Roots

The Gin Sour's origins can be traced back to the British Navy, where spirits like gin were mixed with lemon juice to prevent scurvy among sailors¹. This practice eventually led to the creation of the Gin Sour, which was first recorded in 1856 at Mart Ackermann's Saloon in Toronto, Canada¹. The first known written recipe for a Gin Sour appeared six years later in Jerry Thomas' 1862 "The Bartender's Guide," which included recipes for a Brandy Sour, a Gin Sour, and a Santa Cruz (rum sour)¹.
