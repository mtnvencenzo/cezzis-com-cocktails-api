## New Orleans in a Glass

The **De La Louisiane** is a sophisticated cocktail that hails from the rich cocktail culture of New Orleans. It's a drink that embodies the spirit of the city with its complex flavors and elegant presentation.

## Historical Backdrop

The De La Louisiane, sometimes referred to as **A La Louisiane**, was the signature drink of the historic **Restaurant La Louisiane** in New Orleans, which opened its doors in **1881**¹. The cocktail is a variation on the **Vieux Carré**, another New Orleans classic, and was first documented in Stanley Clisby Arthur's **"Famous New Orleans Drinks and How to Mix 'Em"** in **1937**¹².

## A Revived Classic

Though the De La Louisiane did not reach the heights of its whiskey-laced cousins like the Sazerac or Vieux Carré, it has been rediscovered and is now made in select bars inside and outside of New Orleans¹. The drink begins with the familiar duo of rye whiskey and sweet vermouth, then introduces the herbal flavors of Bénédictine and the anise notes of absinthe, creating a cocktail that is both familiar and unique.

Enjoy your De La Louisiane, a cocktail that's as out-of-the-ordinary as the city it represents! 🍸🎺
