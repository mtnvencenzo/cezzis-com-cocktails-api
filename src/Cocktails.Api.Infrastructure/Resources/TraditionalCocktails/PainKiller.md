## Origins

The story of the Painkiller begins in the **1970s** at the **Soggy Dollar Bar**, a quaint establishment nestled in White Bay on the island of **Jost Van Dyke** in the **British Virgin Islands**. The bar, which got its name because patrons often swam to reach it, leaving their dollar bills soggy, was the birthplace of this iconic drink.

### The Creator

The Painkiller was the brainchild of **Daphne Henderson**, the owner of the Soggy Dollar Bar at the time. However, some accounts also mention **George and Marie Myrick**, previous owners of the bar, as possible inventors.

## Trademark Controversy

In **1989**, **Pusser's Rum Ltd.** filed a US trademark on the Painkiller's name and recipe. This led to a legal dispute when a Tiki bar named Painkiller opened in New York City in 2011, selling Painkiller cocktails made with rums other than Pusser's. The case was settled out of court, resulting in the bar being renamed to PKNY.

## The Painkiller Today

Despite its tumultuous history, the Painkiller is more than just a cocktail; it's a piece of history, a story of innovation, and a celebration of Caribbean culture. Whether you're lounging on a beach or dreaming of one, a Painkiller in hand is sure to soothe the soul.
