## A Roaring Twenties Delight

The **Bee's Knees cocktail**, with its golden hue and zesty flavor, transports us to the **Roaring Twenties**—an era of flappers, jazz, and clandestine speakeasies. This classic libation, born during **Prohibition**, combines the simplicity of gin with the sweetness of honey and the tang of lemon. Let's delve into the history, intrigue, and timeless allure of the Bee's Knees.

## The Mysterious Origins

The Bee's Knees cocktail is shrouded in mystery, with several intriguing stories surrounding its creation:

### Frank Meier's Parisian Invention:

**Frank Meier**, an Austrian-born bartender, worked at the **Café Parisian** in the **Ritz Hotel**, Paris, when it opened in **1921**.  Meier was known for inventing several cocktails, including this simple yet delightful combination of **gin**, **lemon juice**, and **honey syrup** (see recipe below).

### The Unsinkable Molly Brown's Claim:

Another version attributes the Bee's Knees to **Margaret Tobin Brown**, nicknamed **"the unsinkable Molly Brown"** due to her survival of the **Titanic** disaster in **1912**.  According to an April 1929 article, Mrs. Brown frequented women-only bars in Paris and supposedly invented the Bee's Knees gin cocktail.

## Prohibition-Era Adaptation:

During **Prohibition** in the United States, the Bee's Knees gained popularity. Lemon juice and honey syrup were used to mask the flavor of cheap **bathtub gin**. The phrase "the bee's knees" was slang for something excellent or outstanding during that era.
