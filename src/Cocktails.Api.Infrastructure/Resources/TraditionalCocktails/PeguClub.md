The **Pegu Club** is a gin-based cocktail that transports you to the exotic days of British colonial Burma. Named after the **Pegu River**, this refreshing drink was the signature libation of the **Pegu Club**—a social hub for senior government officials, military personnel, and prominent businessmen in **Rangoon** (now **Yangon**), Myanmar.

## Origins

The Pegu Club cocktail first appeared in **1923** in "Harry" of Ciro's **ABC of Mixing Cocktails**. The original recipe used preserved lime juice instead of fresh, but later versions omitted the brand name "Rose's" when specifying lime juice, leading to ambiguity about when bartenders began using fresh lime juice⁴⁵.

## Revival and Legacy

In the early 2000s, bartender **Audrey Saunders** revived the Pegu Club cocktail by opening a bar of the same name in New York City. The Pegu Club became influential in the cocktail renaissance, but unfortunately, it closed in **2020** due to pandemic-related restrictions . Nevertheless, this nearly forgotten gem continues to delight cocktail enthusiasts around the world.

## Gin Recommendations

The Pegu Club pairs beautifully with a wide array of gins. Consider trying it with:

- **Pink peppercorn gin** for a spicy, warming twist.
- **Bright, floral contemporary style gin** like **Harahorn Gin**, **Black Button's Loganberry Gin**, or **Sator Square's American Dry**.

So raise your glass to adventure, camaraderie, and the timeless allure of the Pegu Club! 🍹🌴🌟
