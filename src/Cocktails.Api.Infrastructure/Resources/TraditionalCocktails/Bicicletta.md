## A Breezy Italian Sip

The **Bicicletta cocktail**—a name that evokes leisurely rides through sun-kissed Italian streets—captures the essence of an Italian summer. This classic libation, part of the spritz family, combines the bitter allure of **Campari**, the lightness of **white wine**, and the effervescence of **soda water**. Let's pedal through the history, the regional variations, and the refreshing simplicity of the Bicicletta.

## The Italian Origins

The Bicicletta has been a beloved Italian drink for decades. Its roots trace back to the **1930s**, where it emerged as a breezy cocktail perfect for warm afternoons. The name itself—**"Bicicletta"**—translates to **"bicycle"** in Italian, allegedly named for the mode of transportation in which its drinkers toddle home after several drinks at the local café.

## The Dirty Bicicletta Twist

For a summer weekend away, we decided to riff on the classic Bicicletta. We introduced **cedrata**, an Italian soda made from citron—a citrus fruit not commonly found in the U.S. Cedrata, with its tartness and dry finish, unexpectedly enhanced the bitterness of the Campari. Thus, the **Dirty Bicicletta** was born—a muddied version of the original, but equally refreshing.

## Raise Your Glass

Whether you're sipping it by an Italian lakeside or your own backyard, toast to the Bicicletta—a sip that captures the carefree spirit of summer and the joy of cycling. 🚲🍹
