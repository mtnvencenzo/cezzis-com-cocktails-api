## Historical Ambiguity

The true origin of the Martinez cocktail is unclear, with two early stories attributing its creation to bartender Jerry Thomas at the Occidental Hotel or to a bartender named Richelieu in Martinez, California¹. While records from the time are incomplete, the 1887 edition of Thomas' "The Bar-Tender's Guide" includes a recipe for the Martinez, suggesting its existence during that period¹.

## Modern Interpretations

While the Martinez can be made with many styles of gin, early recipes were reported to have used genever. This style is still a great option for those seeking a deeper cocktail with malty overtones. However, for those seeking the best gin that will hew to historical styles as well as modern tastes, Old Tom-style gin offers elements of both worlds².

Enjoy your Martinez, a cocktail that's part Manhattan, part Martini, and entirely delicious—a true classic that has influenced the course of cocktail history¹².
