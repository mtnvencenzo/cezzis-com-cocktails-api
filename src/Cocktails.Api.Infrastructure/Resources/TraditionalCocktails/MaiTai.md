## History

The Mai Tai is said to have originated at **Trader Vic's**, a restaurant in **Oakland, California**, in **1944**. Victor J. Bergeron, also known as Trader Vic, claimed to have invented the cocktail at his establishment. However, there is some controversy surrounding its creation. Donn Beach (Don the Beachcomber), another influential figure in Tiki culture, also claimed to have created a similar drink called the **Q.B. Cooler** in **1933**. Despite the debate, Trader Vic's version of the Mai Tai gained popularity and became synonymous with Tiki culture.

## Modern Interpretations

Today, bartenders continue to experiment with variations of the Mai Tai, using different rums, additional fruit juices, and creative garnishes. Some prefer a float of dark rum on top for added depth. Whether you're sipping it by the pool or at a Tiki bar, the Mai Tai promises a taste of paradise—a blend of rum, citrus, and almond that transports you to a tropical oasis. 🍹🌺🏝️
