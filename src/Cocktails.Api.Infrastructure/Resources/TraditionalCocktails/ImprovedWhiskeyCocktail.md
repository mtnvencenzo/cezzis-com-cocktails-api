## Historical Evolution

The Improved Whiskey Cocktail made its debut in the mid-19th century, a time when the art of cocktail-making was flourishing. The term "improved" suggests a refinement of an existing recipe, and this cocktail certainly lives up to its name. Its first written record appears in Jerry Thomas's 1876 bartending guide, "How to Mix Drinks or The Bon Vivant's Companion," but it has likely been refined by countless bartenders over the years¹.

In the late 1800s, bartenders began enhancing their drinks with imported European ingredients such as maraschino liqueur, absinthe, and curaçao. These additions made a significant impact on the possibilities of drink-making at the time².
