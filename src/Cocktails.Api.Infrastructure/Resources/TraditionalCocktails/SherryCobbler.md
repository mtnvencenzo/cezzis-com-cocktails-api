## How Sherry Cobbler Tastes

The Sherry Cobbler boasts a refreshing, fruity, and slightly sweet flavor profile. Here's what you can expect:

- **Sherry**: The star of the show, dry amontillado sherry provides a robust and often nutty base. It's essential to the Cobbler's character.
- **Orange**: Half an orange muddled in the mix imparts a sweet citrus burst, complementing the sherry's complexity.
- **Lemon**: Alongside the orange, half a lemon adds a sharp tangy edge, cutting through the sweetness and adding brightness.
- **Sugar**: A touch of sweetness harmonizes the tartness of the citrus with the depth of the sherry.
- **Crushed Ice**: Chilled and gently diluting, it ensures the cocktail remains refreshing.

## Interesting Facts

- **The First Straw**: The Sherry Cobbler is considered one of the first cocktails to use a straw. Crushed ice made it difficult to drink without one, hence the birth of the straw.
- **Cobblestones**: The name "Cobbler" comes from the way the crushed ice resembles cobblestones.
- **Victorian Era Favorite**: During the Victorian era, the Sherry Cobbler was a popular drink at garden parties and picnics.


## Pro Tips

- Adjust the sweetness by varying the amount of sugar based on your sherry's sweetness level.
- Crushed ice is key—don't skip it!
- Sip, savor, and imagine yourself in a sun-dappled garden.
