## Bermuda's Signature Cocktail

The **Dark 'N' Stormy** is a cocktail with a rich history and a distinctive taste that has made it a favorite across the globe. Here's a look into its origins and how to make this classic drink:

## Nautical Beginnings

The Dark 'N' Stormy has its roots in Bermuda, where the combination of dark rum and ginger beer first became popular among sailors. The drink is said to have been created in the early 20th century and is closely associated with **Gosling's Black Seal Rum**, a key ingredient that gives the cocktail its signature dark hue¹²³.

## Trademark and Authenticity

Interestingly, the name "Dark 'N' Stormy" is a trademark of Gosling Brothers Ltd of Bermuda. By law, a Dark 'N' Stormy must be made with Gosling's Black Seal Rum to be considered authentic. The company has even taken legal action to protect its trademark, ensuring that the drink's identity remains tied to its original rum¹².

## Flavor Profile

The Dark 'N' Stormy features a refreshing trio of dark rum, ginger beer, and lime. It's a close cousin to the Moscow Mule and offers a familiar yet distinct taste. The robust flavors of Gosling's rum, with notes of caramel, vanilla, and spice, are complemented by the spicy bite of ginger beer¹.
