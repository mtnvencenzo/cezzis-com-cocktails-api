## A Pink-Hued Classic

The **Clover Club** is a cocktail that harks back to the golden age of American bartending. It's a drink that combines elegance with a fruity punch, making it a perennial favorite.

## Historical Roots
The Clover Club cocktail is named after the Philadelphia men's club of the same name, which met at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel². The club, which began in the late 1800s and continued into the early 20th century, was a gathering place for journalists, lawyers, and businessmen who enjoyed good food, lively conversation, and fine drinks¹.

## Modern Resurgence

The Clover Club cocktail saw a decline in popularity post-Prohibition but made a comeback in 2008 when Julie Reiner opened a bar in Brooklyn and featured the drink on the menu⁵. It's now celebrated as a classic cocktail, enjoyed by those who appreciate the blend of gin's herbal notes with the sweetness of raspberry and the tartness of lemon.

Enjoy your Clover Club, a cocktail that's as much about taste as it is about tradition! 🍸🌸
