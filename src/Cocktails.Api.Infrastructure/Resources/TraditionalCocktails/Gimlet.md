## Nautical Beginnings

The Gimlet's story begins in the 19th century with the British Royal Navy. Scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C, was a significant threat to sailors on long voyages. To combat this, the Navy provided lime rations, which led to British sailors being nicknamed "limeys"⁴⁷.

The cocktail's name is believed to have two possible origins. It may be named after the tool for drilling small holes, alluding to its "piercing" effect on the drinker. Alternatively, it could be named after Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Gimlette, a Royal Navy surgeon who allegedly introduced the drink as a means of inducing his shipmates to take lime juice as an anti-scurvy medication⁴.

## Recipe Evolution

The traditional Gimlet was a 50/50 mix of gin and Rose's lime juice cordial, a preserved lime juice. Over time, as tastes evolved, the ratio often changed to less sweet versions, with modern palates preferring more gin to lime cordial⁴.

## Modern Variations

Today, the Gimlet has given rise to variations like the Vodka Gimlet and adaptations using fresh lime juice and simple syrup instead of lime cordial. The cocktail's basic template has become a staple in cocktail culture, influencing many other "sour" category drinks².

The Gimlet remains a beloved classic, a testament to its enduring appeal and the history it carries. Whether enjoyed in its most traditional form or with a contemporary twist, the Gimlet continues to be a refreshing choice for cocktail aficionados around the world¹²⁴.
