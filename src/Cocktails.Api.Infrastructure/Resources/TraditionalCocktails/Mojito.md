## Historical Roots

The birthplace of the Mojito is Havana, Cuba, although its exact origin is a subject of debate¹. It's believed that the drink's precursor was a 16th-century concoction known as "El Draque," named after Sir Francis Drake. The original mixture of aguardiente (a precursor to rum), lime, mint, and sugar was used for medicinal purposes, but it's easy to imagine that its flavor was enjoyed as well⁶.

As rum became widely available, it replaced aguardiente, and the Mojito evolved into the form we know today. The cocktail first appeared in cocktail literature in the 1932 edition of "Sloppy Joe's Bar Cocktail Manual," a book from the famed Havana institution⁶.

## Modern-Day Sipping

Today, the Mojito is enjoyed worldwide and is especially popular in the summer months for its cooling properties. Whether you're lounging on a beach or hosting a backyard barbecue, the Mojito's blend of rum, mint, and lime is sure to provide a refreshing escape from the heat.

Enjoy your Mojito, a cocktail that captures the essence of Cuban spirit and flavor. ¡Salud! 🍹🌿
