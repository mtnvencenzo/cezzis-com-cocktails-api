The **Margarita** is one of the most popular cocktails in North America, and for good reason. Combining the tang of lime, the sweetness of orange liqueur, and the distinctive flavor of tequila, the classic Margarita remains a recognizable and timeless example of the sour category of cocktails.

## Origin and Legends

The history of the Margarita is shrouded in mystery and folklore, with several origin stories competing for attention:

**Tequila Daisy**: Some believe the Margarita is related to the brandy daisy, remade with tequila instead of brandy. Daisies are a family of cocktails that include a base spirit, liqueur, and citrus. The Margarita is essentially a tequila-based Daisy.  

**Tijuana Creation**: In 1938, bartender Carlos "Danny" Herrera supposedly invented the Margarita at his restaurant, Rancho La Gloria, between Tijuana and Rosarito, Baja California. He created it for a customer, Marjorie King, who was allergic to many spirits but not to tequila.  

**Showgirl Tribute**: Jose Cuervo claims the cocktail was invented in 1938 by a bartender in honor of Mexican showgirl Rita de la Rosa.  

**Picador**: The 1937 Café Royal Cocktail Book includes a recipe for a Picador, a British ancestor of the Margarita, using the same proportions of tequila, triple sec, and lime juice.  


## Tommy's Margarita

An iconic variant, the Tommy's Margarita, skips the orange liqueur and uses agave syrup instead. It's a simpler, more agave-forward version.

Remember, quality ingredients matter. Use fresh lime juice and a good 100% agave white tequila. Whether you're sipping it on the rocks or blended, the Margarita promises a taste of Mexico—a perfect balance of strong, sweet, and sour flavors. Salud! 🍹🌵🍋
