## Historical Shot

The Mexican Firing Squad was first recorded by the globetrotting author and cocktail enthusiast Charles H. Baker in his 1939 guide, "The Gentleman's Companion"¹. Baker discovered the drink at the La Cucaracha Bar in Mexico City, a place that, despite its name, was far from a seedy dive. Instead, it was a swanky Prohibition-era establishment, known for its extensive cocktail menu and an illustration of a cigar-smoking insect in a tuxedo and top hat¹.

## Modern-Day Revival

While not as famous as other tequila-based cocktails like the Margarita, the Mexican Firing Squad offers a deliciously tart alternative that's just as refreshing². The name's origin remains a mystery, perhaps as enigmatic as the drink itself. Some suggest it might have been named for its punchy flavors or perhaps after a night of too many led one to feel like facing a firing squad².

Enjoy your Mexican Firing Squad, a cocktail with a history as intriguing as its blend of flavors. 🍹🇲🇽
