## A Pre-Prohibition Elixir
The Corpse Reviver No. 2 belongs to a family of pre-Prohibition cocktails known as "corpse revivers." These drinks were said to be created and consumed for the chief purpose of rousing the drinker from the dead—in other words, meant to cure hangovers, increase vigor, and otherwise improve one's morning¹. The name itself suggests that it was a remedy for the aftermath of a night of indulgence.

## Historical Traces
The use of the words "corpse reviver" to describe a mixed drink appears in literature as early as an issue of **Punch** in **1861**. One recipe from the **Gentleman's Table Guide** in **1871** called for 1/2 a wine glass of brandy, 1/2 a wine glass of Maraschino, and two dashes of Boker's bitters³.

## The Role of Lillet Blanc
Lillet Blanc (or Cocchi Americano) functions similarly to vermouth, binding the ingredients together while adding depth of flavor. The absinthe rinse provides an aromatic hint without overwhelming the palate.

Remember, the Corpse Reviver No. 2 is more potent than it tastes. As Harry Craddock warned in his "Savoy Cocktail Book," "Four of these taken in swift succession will un-revive the corpse again."

Enjoy your Corpse Reviver No. 2—it's a tart, cold, and refreshing elixir! 🍋🥃
