## Historical Background

The Philadelphia Fish House Punch was first concocted in **1732** at Philadelphia's fishing club, the **State in Schuylkill**, also known as the "fish house"¹. It is one of the oldest known American punch recipes, and it has a reputation for being both delightful and deceptively strong.

### The Club

The State in Schuylkill, America's first angling club, was a pre-revolution social hub for colonial elites. The club was known for its exclusive membership and its penchant for hearty celebrations¹.

### George Washington's Indulgence

Even America's first president, **George Washington**, is said to have indulged in the punch. Legend has it that after partaking of the Fish House Punch, he couldn't bring himself to make an entry in his diary for the following three days¹.

## Serving Tradition

The punch is traditionally served over an ice block in a punch bowl, garnished with lemon slices. It's a communal drink, meant to be shared among friends and family at gatherings and celebrations.

The Philadelphia Fish House Punch is a testament to the rich history of American mixology. Its enduring popularity reminds us of the time-honored tradition of sharing a good drink in good company. So, gather your friends, raise your glasses, and enjoy a piece of colonial Americana!
