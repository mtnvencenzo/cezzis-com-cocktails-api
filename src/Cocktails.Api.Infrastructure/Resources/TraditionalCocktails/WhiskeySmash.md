## Origin

The Whiskey Smash has a storied past, dating back to the 19th century. While its exact origin remains somewhat elusive, it made its recipe-book debut in the 1887 edition of “The Bartenders Guide” by Jerry Thomas. However, variations of this fruit-and-whiskey concoction likely existed for decades prior to its inclusion in the guide. After all, bartenders and drinkers had been making juleps since the 1700s, and the citrusy Whiskey Sour was already in rotation when the Whiskey Smash came onto the scene.

## History

**Muddling Tradition**: A good Whiskey Smash requires a good muddler. The goal is to compress the lemon wedges to release not only their juices but also the oils in the peel. This combination creates a richer taste when combined with the whiskey and sugar.

**Dale DeGroff's Influence**: Legendary bartender Dale DeGroff, aka King Cocktail, reintroduced the Whiskey Smash to modern drinkers during his tenure at the Rainbow Room in New York during the late 1980s and 1990s. His version featured bourbon, muddled lemon wedges, and mint. DeGroff considered the citrus-and-mint combination the perfect cocktail for those who claimed they'd never drink whiskey.

## Conclusion

The Whiskey Smash is more than just a cocktail; it's a celebration of bright flavors and timeless simplicity. Whether you're a seasoned whiskey lover or a newcomer to the spirit, the Whiskey Smash is sure to charm your taste buds.
