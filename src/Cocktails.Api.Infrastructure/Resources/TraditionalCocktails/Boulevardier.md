## A Negroni's Bourbon Cousin

This recipe balances the whiskey's warmth with Campari's bitterness and the herbal sweetness of vermouth, creating a cocktail that's both complex and harmonious¹².

## The Negroni Connection

Often compared to the Negroni, the Boulevardier is a whiskey-based variant that predates the more famous gin-based cocktail. It's a rich and warming drink, perfect for cooler evenings, and has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to the craft cocktail movement.

## Origins and Rediscovery
The Boulevardier cocktail, a Parisian creation of the 1920s, was the brainchild of American writer Erskine Gwynne. He named it after his magazine, "The Boulevardier," and it was popularized at Harry McElhone's Harry's New York Bar in Paris. The drink was a hit among the expatriate community and featured in McElhone's 1927 bar guide, "Barflies and Cocktails."

Enjoy your Boulevardier, a toast to the timeless elegance of Paris in the 1920s! 🍹🇫🇷
