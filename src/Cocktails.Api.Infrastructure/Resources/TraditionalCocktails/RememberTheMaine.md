## Origin

The cocktail's name pays homage to the USS Maine, an American naval ship whose tragic sinking in Havana Harbor in 1898 became a pivotal moment leading to the Spanish-American War. The rallying cry "Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain!" echoed across the nation, urging action and stirring patriotic fervor.

## Unearthing History

The recipe for "Remember The Maine" was first documented by Charles H. Baker, Jr. in his 1939 book, "The Gentleman's Companion." Baker, a globetrotting bon vivant, encountered this libation during his travels in Havana. The year was 1933, a time when the clinking of glasses mingled with the sounds of political upheaval—the Cuban Revolution was in full swing.
