## Origin and History

**Antoine Amedie Peychaud**: The Sazerac's story begins with Antoine Amedie Peychaud, a pharmacist from Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). He settled in New Orleans during the Haitian Revolution and opened an apothecary. Among his wares was **Peychaud's Bitters**, initially marketed as a curative but soon embraced by cocktail enthusiasts.  

**The Birth of the Sazerac**: Peychaud began mixing his bitters with French brandy, sugar, and water, creating an elixir that gained popularity. Locals sought it out not only for its supposed health benefits but also for its delightful taste. Thus, the Sazerac cocktail was born.  

**The Sazerac Coffee House**: By the 1850s, the Sazerac was the signature drink at the Sazerac Coffee House in New Orleans. Bartender **Thomas H. Handy** later purchased the bar, and his liquor business would eventually become the **Sazerac Company**.  

**From Cognac to Rye Whiskey**: Originally made with French brandy, the Sazerac shifted to American rye whiskey around 1885 due to the phylloxera epidemic that devastated French vineyards. Rye whiskey's spiciness paired perfectly with the cocktail's other ingredients.
