## Origin

In the 1930s, Donn Beach opened his lively Hollywood bar, Don the Beachcomber, which became ground zero for the Tiki-style of drink. The Zombie emerged from this vibrant scene, a concoction that epitomized the era's fascination with escapism, adventure, and mysterious flavors.

## History

### A Drink is Born
In the world of cocktails, few have a backstory as intriguing as the Zombie. This potent Tiki drink was concocted by Donn Beach, originally known as Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt, in his Hollywood bar, Don the Beachcomber, sometime around 1934. The Zombie quickly became a sensation, known for its strong alcohol content and complex flavor profile.

### The Legend of the Zombie
The cocktail's name is said to have originated from an incident involving a hung-over customer who had a business meeting to attend. Donn Beach whipped up this concoction as a cure, and the customer later claimed it made him feel like a zombie throughout his trip. This tale has cemented the Zombie's reputation as a powerful elixir.

### Secretive Stirrings
Donn Beach was notorious for guarding his recipes closely, often writing them in code to keep them from prying eyes. This secrecy led to numerous variations of the Zombie being created by other bartenders, each with their own interpretation of what the original might have tasted like.

### The World's Fair Debut
The Zombie's fame spread far and wide after it was featured at the 1939 New York World's Fair. This event introduced the East Coast to the Tiki culture that was flourishing on the West Coast, and the Zombie was at the forefront of this tropical drink movement.

### The Classic Composition
The traditional Zombie cocktail is a blend of various rums, lime juice, falernum, Angostura bitters, grenadine, and a special mix known as “Don's Mix,” which combines cinnamon syrup with grapefruit juice. The result is a drink that's as complex as its history.

### A Revival of Tiki Traditions

Today, the Zombie remains a beloved part of Tiki culture, embodying the spirit of tropical escapism and mid-century American cocktail innovation. Modern bartenders continue to pay homage to this classic, ensuring that the legend of the Zombie lives on in bars and Tiki lounges around the world.

## Conclusion

The Zombie is more than a cocktail; it's a journey to a mythical island, where palm trees sway, waves crash, and the sun kisses your skin. Sip it slowly, and let the Tiki magic transport you—just be careful not to have too many; they might make you feel like the walking dead.
