## Historical Backdrop

The Gin Rickey's story begins in the late 19th century with Colonel Joe Rickey, a Democratic lobbyist in Washington, D.C. Colonel Rickey was known for his preference for zero-sugar drinks and would often enjoy a combination of bourbon and carbonated water. One day, at Shoomaker's bar, he asked the bartender to add some lime to his usual highball, thus creating the Bourbon Rickey¹.

As the drink's popularity soared, people began customizing it to their liking, and the Gin Rickey eventually became the most popular version. The Gin Rickey swapped bourbon for gin, taking advantage of gin's natural ability to pair with fresh lime and sparkling water².

## Modern-Day Enjoyment

The Gin Rickey has remained a popular drink for decades, even making an appearance in the 1925 classic, "The Great Gatsby." In 2011, over a century after its creation, the Rickey was officially declared Washington D.C.'s native cocktail. Today, it's still a common serve in D.C. and beyond, enjoyed for its thirst-quenching and light qualities⁶.

Enjoy your Gin Rickey, a cocktail that's as much a part of political history as it is a staple of the American bar scene. 🍸🍈
