## A Jewel of the Bar

The Bijou cocktail, French for "jewel," dates back to the late 19th century. It was created by the legendary bartender **Harry Johnson** and first appeared in his **"Bartender's Manual"** in the 1880s⁵. The cocktail's name reflects the colors of its ingredients, which represent different gemstones: gin for diamond, sweet vermouth for ruby, and green Chartreuse for emerald¹.

## Prohibition and Resurgence
Like many pre-prohibition cocktails, the Bijou disappeared during the 1920s when alcohol was banned in the US. However, it celebrated a comeback in the 1980s, regaining its place in the cocktail world¹.

## The Modern Bijou
The original recipe called for equal parts of gin, sweet vermouth, and Chartreuse, but modern versions often adjust the proportions to create a more balanced flavor⁵.

## Flavor Profile
The Bijou is a boozy, dry, and herbaceous cocktail, served straight up in a coupe glass or Nick & Nora¹. The gin provides a crisp base, the vermouth adds sweetness and complexity, and the green Chartreuse delivers a potent herbal punch, with its 130 herbs and spices¹.

Enjoy your Bijou, a cocktail that truly lives up to its name, offering a dazzling array of flavors in every sip! 🍸💎
