### Roots in England

While the Old Fashioned is often associated with the United States, its roots actually trace back to England. In the 1700s, even before the cocktail's official history began, advertisements for **Stoughton's bitters** promoted the template of mixing a base spirit, simple syrup, and bitters. Dr. Richard Stoughton's concentrated bitters, made from botanicals like barks, peels, and roots, were recommended for adding to brandy or wine to cure hangovers. This early concoction bears a striking resemblance to the Old Fashioned we know today.

### The Birth of the Term "Cocktail"

The first documented use of the word "cocktail" appeared in the *Balance and Columbian Repository* in Hudson, New York, in 1806. The definition described it as a "concoction of spirits, bitters, water, and sugar." Here's the original excerpt:

> "I have heard of a forum, of phlegm-cutter and fog driver, of wetting the whistle, of moistening the clay, of a fillip, a spur in the head, quenching a spark in the throat, of flip &c, but never in my life, though I have lived a good many years, did I hear of cock tail before. Is it peculiar to a part of this country? Or is it a late invention? Is the name expressive of the effect which the drink has on a particular part of the body?"

This early reference to a mixed drink laid the groundwork for what would become the Old Fashioned.

### The True Old Fashioned Emerges

By the mid-19th century, cocktails had become more complex, incorporating liqueurs and additional ingredients. However, some patrons longed for simpler drinks reminiscent of the pre-1850s era. The original concoction, albeit in different proportions, made a comeback and was affectionately referred to as the "old-fashioned" cocktail. Whiskey, particularly rye, became the spirit of choice, and the classic recipe was revived.

### The Pendennis Club Connection

The **Pendennis Club**, a gentlemen's club founded in 1881 in Louisville, Kentucky, claims to have invented the Old Fashioned cocktail. According to legend, a bartender at the club created the recipe in honor of Colonel James E. Pepper, a prominent bourbon distiller. Colonel Pepper then introduced the cocktail to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel bar in New York City, solidifying its place in cocktail history.

## Conclusion
Whether sipped in a dimly lit speakeasy or enjoyed at home, the Old Fashioned pays homage to an era when elegance and tradition reigned supreme. So raise your glass to the Old Fashioned—a true testament to the enduring allure of a well-crafted cocktail! 🥃🍊🍒
