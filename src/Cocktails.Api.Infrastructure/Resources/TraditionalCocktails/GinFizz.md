## Historical Roots

The Gin Fizz is part of the Daisy family of cocktails, which began as a template for drinks combining a spirit, citrus juice, and a sweetener.  The cocktail is a variation of the older 'fizz' family of cocktails, which were characterized by their inclusion of carbonated water and citrus with the first written recipe for a Daisy cocktail appearing in Jerry Thomas' "The Bar-tender's Guide" in 1876, marking the official birth of the Gin Fizz.  The Ramos Gin Fizz was first created in New Orleans by **Henry C. Ramos** and quickly gained popularity in the United States and Europe.

## Why Add Egg White?

While the egg white is optional, it gives the Gin Fizz a delightful smoothness and a frothy top. The dry shake method (shaking without ice) ensures that the egg white creates a luscious mouthfeel and a silky texture.

Remember, consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs poses a risk of foodborne illness, so use fresh eggs and consider the vegan alternative, aquafaba (liquid from cooked chickpeas), for a similar foaming effect.

## Modern-Day Refreshment

Today, the Gin Fizz stands out for its effervescence and is often served over crushed ice, reminiscent of a snow cone. It's a light and breezy drink that's almost like a grown-up lemonade, with bright, tart, and delicate flavors of berry and citrus. London dry gin is a good Juniper-forward gin option for this drink.

Enjoy your Gin Fizz—a refreshing blend of citrus, botanicals, and effervescence! 🍋🥂
