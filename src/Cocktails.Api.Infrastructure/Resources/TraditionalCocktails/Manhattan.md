## Origin and History

The Manhattan cocktail likely dates back to the **1860s** and is believed to have been invented by a bartender named **Black** while working at a bar on **Houston Street** in **Broadway, New York**. However, like many vintage cocktails, its exact origin is shrouded in mystery, and there are several competing stories.

### The Manhattan Club Story

One popular tale attributes the Manhattan's creation to the **Manhattan Club** in **New York City**. According to this version, the drink was invented for a party held in late **1874** by **Lady Randolph Churchill** (Winston Churchill's mother) in honor of presidential candidate **Samuel J. Tilden**. The club claimed that the cocktail was named after their establishment. However, Lady Randolph was not even in the US during that time, casting doubt on this story.

### The More Likely Version

Historians believe that the Manhattan was invented by **William F. Mulhall**, a respected bartender at **Hoffman House** in **New York City**. Mulhall's recipe closely resembles the classic Manhattan we know today. It's likely that the cocktail predates the Manhattan Club's claim.

## Bourbon vs. Rye

While bourbon is commonly used today, rye whiskey was likely the original spirit in the Manhattan. Rye's spicier flavor pairs beautifully with the sweet vermouth. Feel free to experiment with both to find your preference.
