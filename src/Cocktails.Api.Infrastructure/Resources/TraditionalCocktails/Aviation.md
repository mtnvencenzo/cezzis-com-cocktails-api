## A Sky-High Elixir

The **Aviation cocktail**—a delicate blend of gin, maraschino liqueur, lemon juice, and a hint of violet—soars above the clouds, capturing the essence of flight and adventure. This classic libation, with its pale blue hue and floral notes, invites us to imagine propellers spinning and the wind in our hair. Let's explore the origins, the skyward sips, and the timeless allure of the Aviation.

## The Early Takeoff

In the early 20th century, **Hugo Ensslin**, head bartender at the **Hotel Wallick in New York**, crafted the Aviation cocktail. His 1916 recipe featured a harmonious combination of **El Bart gin**, **lemon juice**, **maraschino liqueur**, and **crème de violette**. The latter, with its violet hue, added a touch of elegance and mystery.

## The Violet Sky

The Aviation's original recipe included crème de violette, which lent a subtle floral flavor and turned the cocktail a pale blue. However, **Harry Craddock's influential Savoy Cocktail Book (1930)** omitted the crème de violette, simplifying the drink to a mixture of dry gin, lemon juice, and maraschino. Many bartenders followed suit, leaving out the elusive violet liqueur.

## Modern Variations

While some purists insist on crème de violette, others embrace its cousin, **Creme Yvette**, a violet liqueur infused with additional spices. The Aviation remains a canvas for creativity, allowing bartenders to experiment with floral and citrus notes.

## The High Altitude Toast

Whether you're at a rooftop bar or your own balcony, raise your glass to the Aviation—a sip that captures the spirit of flight, adventure, and the boundless sky. 🛩️🌸
