## A Potent Pairing

The cocktail's opalescent appearance occurs when the Champagne meets the absinthe. The aromatic compounds in absinthe are more soluble in alcohol than in water, so when diluted, they drop out of solution, creating cloudiness—a mesmerizing transformation.

## Hemingway's Influence

Ernest Hemingway, known for both his literary prowess and love of libations, left an indelible mark on cocktail culture. The Death in the Afternoon is one of his creations, combining two distinct ingredients: **absinthe** and **Champagne**.

## The Perfect Pairing

The Death in the Afternoon is a smart introduction to absinthe for those new to the spirit. The effervescent blend of wormwood-and-anise-flavored absinthe with dry Champagne results in a strong yet surprisingly refreshing drink. It's perfect for brunch or leisurely afternoons spent reading—a nod to its creator's literary legacy.

Remember, moderation is key. Enjoy your Death in the Afternoon—a drink that bridges the gap between literature and libations! 🥂📖
