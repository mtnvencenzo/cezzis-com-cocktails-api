## Origins and Traditions

The Mint Julep's roots trace back to the 18th century, and it first appeared in print in John Davis' book "Travels of Four and a Half Years in the United States of America" (1803). Virginians were known to enjoy this "dram of spirituous liquor" with mint steeped in it as a morning pick-me-up⁶. Over time, the Mint Julep gained prominence in the Southern United States, and it became synonymous with the Kentucky Derby.

## Tips for the Perfect Mint Julep

**Muddle the Mint:** Gently muddle the mint leaves to release their essential oils without tearing the leaves.  

**High-Quality Bourbon:** Use a bourbon you love, ideally with a slightly higher proof (mid-80s or around 90) to prevent quick dilution.  

**Silver Julep Cup:** Traditionally, Mint Juleps are served in silver cups, but any tall glass will work.

Whether you're watching the Kentucky Derby or simply enjoying a sunny afternoon, the Mint Julep's sweet, smoky, and herbal flavors make it a refreshing choice. Cheers! 🍹🌿🥃
