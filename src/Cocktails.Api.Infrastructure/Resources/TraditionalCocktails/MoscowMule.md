## Historical Stir

The Moscow Mule was invented in **1941** in **Los Angeles** as part of a marketing strategy to boost the sales of Smirnoff vodka and Cock ‘n' Bull ginger beer³. The cocktail gained popularity through a clever marketing campaign by Smirnoff and became one of the most popular cocktails in America by the 1950s³.


## The Iconic Copper Mug

A distinctive feature of the Moscow Mule is its presentation in a copper mug. The cold metal insulates the liquid inside, keeping the cocktail cool and enhancing its flavor profile². The origin of the copper mug is linked to a Russian woman named Sophie Berezinski, whose father owned the Moscow Copper Co. She brought the mugs to America to sell, and they became an integral part of the Moscow Mule's identity⁷.

Enjoy your Moscow Mule, a cocktail that's as much a part of cocktail culture as it is a piece of marketing genius. Cheers! 🍹🥄🍋
