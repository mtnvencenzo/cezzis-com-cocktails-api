## Origin

The Vesper first stirred to life in the pages of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel "Casino Royale," where it was ordered by the novel's protagonist, the quintessential spy, James Bond². The cocktail was named after the fictional double agent Vesper Lynd, Bond's love interest in the story.

## History

**Literary Creation**: Unlike most cocktails that are the brainchild of seasoned bartenders, the Vesper was invented by an author. Fleming's Bond provides a precise recipe for the Vesper in the novel, leaving little room for interpretation¹.

**The Name**: The cocktail's name was a play on words, drawing inspiration from the religious observance of Vespers, which is typically held at sunset. Bond praises the name as "very appropriate to the violet hour when my cocktail will now be drunk all over the world"².

## Conclusion

The Vesper is more than a cocktail; it's a piece of literary and cinematic history. It's a drink that captures the imagination and evokes the cool, collected demeanor of its fictional creator. Whether you're a spy fan or a cocktail aficionado, the Vesper is a must-try—a drink that's shaken, not stirred, into legend.
