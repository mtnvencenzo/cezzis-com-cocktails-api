## A New Orleans Classic

The **Absinthe Frappé**—a name that conjures images of icy refreshment and clandestine allure—has a storied history rooted in the heart of New Orleans.

## Origins and the Birthplace

In **1874**, at what would later be known as the **Old Absinthe House** in New Orleans, bartender **Cayetano Ferrer** crafted the Absinthe Frappé. This unassuming drink would go on to captivate the palates of patrons who frequented the historic establishment. Imagine the dimly lit bar, the clinking of glasses, and the whispers of famous guests.

## Hollywood Connections

Although the Absinthe Frappé has its roots in New Orleans, it transcended geographical boundaries. In **1904**, the Broadway musical *It Happened in Nordland* featured lyrics by **Glen MacDonough** set to **Victor Herbert's tune**, aptly titled "Absinthe Frappé." The song celebrated the drink's icy allure and its ability to free one from life's burdens. Even though the song emerged from New York, the concoction itself was born in the Crescent City.

## Celebrity Patrons

The Old Absinthe House welcomed a diverse clientele, including literary luminaries like **Oscar Wilde**, the irreverent wit of **Mark Twain**, and the esteemed **General Robert E. Lee**. They all swore by the Absinthe Frappé—a strong, chilled libation that provided respite from the New Orleans heat.

## The Prohibition Era

In **1912**, the United States banned the sale of **absinthe** due to widespread claims that it caused hallucinations, madness, and even death. The main culprit was **wormwood extract**, a key ingredient in absinthe. As a result, **Pernod** and **Herbsaint** were substituted for the real thing.

## The Revival

In a twist of fate, absinthe turned out to be less dangerous than feared. In **2007**, the ban was lifted in the United States, and many New Orleans bars returned to serving the authentic spirit. Today, the Absinthe Frappé lives on, inviting both locals and visitors to experience a taste of history.

Whether you're in New Orleans or mixing it at home, raise your glass to the Absinthe Frappé—a timeless libation that bridges eras and continents. 🥃🌿
