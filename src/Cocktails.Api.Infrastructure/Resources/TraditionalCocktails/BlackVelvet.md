## A Cocktail of Mourning Turned Celebration

The Black Velvet cocktail is a drink with a somber origin, created in **1861** at **Brooks's Club** in London. It was invented to mourn the death of **Prince Albert**, Queen Victoria's Prince Consort¹. The cocktail's dark hue was meant to reflect the black armbands worn by mourners, symbolizing that "even the champagne should be in mourning."

## A Layered Legacy
The Black Velvet is traditionally made by mixing equal parts of stout (often Guinness) and white sparkling wine (often Champagne). The drink can also be served in a layered variation, where the stout is floated on top of the Champagne to create a visually striking separation of colors¹.

## Modern Interpretation
While the Black Velvet began as a drink of mourning, it has transcended its origins to become a beverage enjoyed for various occasions. Its unique combination of stout's richness and Champagne's effervescence makes it a timeless choice for celebrations and gatherings¹.

Enjoy your Black Velvet, a cocktail that elegantly bridges the gap between beer and sparkling wine! 🍺🥂
