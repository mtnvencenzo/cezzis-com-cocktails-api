## Origins

The Pisco Sour's birthplace is **Peru**, although there's some friendly rivalry with **Chile** over its origins. Here's the most widely accepted tale:

- **Victor Vaughen Morris**, an American bartender who moved to Peru in **1903**, opened the **Morris Bar** in Lima. Around **1915** or the early **1920s**, he created the Pisco Sour as an alternative to the Whiskey Sour. The modern version emerged in the late **1920s** when bartender **Mario Bruige** added **Angostura bitters** and **egg white** to the mix .

The **Pisco Sour** is a testament to the rich history of American mixology. Its enduring popularity reminds us of the time-honored tradition of sharing a good drink in good company. So, gather your friends, raise your glasses, and enjoy a piece of colonial Americana! 🍍🥥🍹
