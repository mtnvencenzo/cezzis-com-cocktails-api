## Historical Sip

The Negroni's history is as rich as its taste. The most popular story dates back to **1919** at **Caffè Casoni** in Florence, Italy. The tale goes that Count Camillo Negroni asked the bartender, Fosco Scarselli, to strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano, by replacing the soda water with gin. The bartender also added an orange garnish rather than the typical lemon garnish of the Americano to signify the new drink³⁴. The Negroni family later opened a distillery producing a ready-made version of the cocktail, called Antico Negroni 1919².

## Modern-Day Twist

Today, the Negroni is often served as an aperitif, enjoyed before a meal to stimulate the appetite. Its popularity has given rise to numerous variations, including the Negroni Sbagliato, where sparkling wine is used instead of gin, and the Boulevardier, which substitutes bourbon for gin.

Enjoy your Negroni, a cocktail that's as timeless as it is bold. Salute! 🍹🇮🇹
