## Origins

The story of the Pimm's Cup begins with **James Pimm**, a London fishmonger who owned an oyster bar between **1823** and **1840**. Seeking to set himself apart, Pimm created a special gin-based liqueur that would serve as the base for a unique cocktail. His concoction included gin, various herbs, spices, fruit, and quinine (which aided digestion and also treated malaria). The result was the delightful Pimm's No. 1 Cup¹.

## The Secret Recipe

James Pimm kept the contents of his sweet, spicy, and complex concoction a closely guarded secret. Legend has it that only **six people** alive today know the true recipe—a mystery akin to the closely guarded formula of Coca-Cola! Pimm's No. 1 Cup became a hit, and by **1851**, Pimm's started large-scale production. Over time, they introduced other versions, including Pimm's No. 2 (with Scotch whiskey) and No. 3 (with brandy)¹.

## The Perfect Summer Sip

The Pimm's Cup is synonymous with English summer events, including the **Chelsea Flower Show**, the **Henley Royal Regatta**, and the **Royal Ascot**. For the past **50 years**, it has been associated with **Wimbledon** as well. So, let's raise our glasses to this delightful tradition!
