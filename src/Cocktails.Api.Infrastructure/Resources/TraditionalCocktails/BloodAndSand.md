## A Scotch Whisky Classic

The Blood and Sand is a harmonious blend of flavors, combining Scotch whisky, cherry liqueur, sweet vermouth, and fresh orange juice. 

## Origins and Silent Film Inspiration
The Blood and Sand cocktail has a mysterious past, much like the silent-film star it's named after. Here's what we know:

**Rudolph Valentino**, known as "The Latin Lover," starred in the 1922 movie **"Blood and Sand"**. The film centered around a bullfighter and was based on the novel by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez.  While the movie wasn't hailed as a masterpiece, Valentino's performance left an impression. The cocktail's name pays homage to the film, linking the **blood orange juice** (representing blood) and the **sweet vermouth** (representing sand).

## Flavor Notes
- **Scotch**: The choice of Scotch matters—some are smokier than others. Adjust based on your preference.
- **Sweet Vermouth**: Herbaceous and spicy, it balances the drink.
- **Cherry Heering Liqueur**: Sweet, fruity, and rich.
- **Orange Juice**: Freshly squeezed for the perfect balance.

The Blood and Sand is a classic Scotch cocktail dating back to at least 1930. Despite its unconventional combination, it works beautifully. Enjoy this timeless libation! 🥃🍊🌅
