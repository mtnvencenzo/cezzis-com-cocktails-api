## A Modern Classic

The **Paper Plane** represents one of the most successful innovations in modern cocktail culture‚Äîa sophisticated blend of bourbon, Aperol, Amaro Nonino, and lemon juice that has become a global phenomenon. Created by Sam Ross in the late 2000s, this innovative cocktail perfectly captures the energy and sophistication of the modern cocktail renaissance.

## The Birth of the Paper Plane

The Paper Plane was developed by Sam Ross, a bartender who has become one of the most influential figures in modern mixology. Inspired by the classic Last Word cocktail and the growing popularity of amari, Ross created this drink as a way to showcase the complexity and versatility of bitter liqueurs. The cocktail's name refers to the M.I.A. song "Paper Planes," reflecting the contemporary cultural influences that shape modern cocktail creation.

## The Last Word Connection

The Paper Plane maintains the equal-parts structure of the classic Last Word‚Äîfour ingredients in equal proportions‚Äîwhile replacing the original ingredients with contemporary alternatives. This approach demonstrates how modern bartenders can honor classic cocktail structures while introducing new ingredients and flavors. The result is a drink that feels both familiar and excitingly new.

## A Celebration of Amari

What makes the Paper Plane particularly compelling is its use of two different amari‚ÄîAperol and Amaro Nonino‚Äîwhich creates a complex flavor profile that showcases the diversity of Italian bitter liqueurs. Aperol provides bright, citrusy bitterness, while Amaro Nonino adds depth and herbal complexity. This combination has helped introduce many drinkers to the world of amari.

## The Bourbon Renaissance

The Paper Plane arrived during a pivotal moment in bourbon's history, when the spirit was experiencing a global renaissance. The cocktail's success helped showcase bourbon's versatility, demonstrating that the spirit could be used in sophisticated cocktails that appealed to discerning palates. This approach has helped establish bourbon as a versatile cocktail ingredient.

## Global Influence

Since its creation, the Paper Plane has gained popularity worldwide, appearing on menus from New York to London to Tokyo. Its appeal transcends cultural boundaries, making it a favorite among both professional bartenders and home enthusiasts. The cocktail's success has helped establish equal-parts cocktails as a legitimate category in modern mixology.

## A Testament to Balance

The Paper Plane's enduring popularity lies in its perfect balance of flavors‚Äîthe bourbon's sweetness, the Aperol's bright bitterness, the Amaro Nonino's herbal complexity, and the lemon's acidity create a harmonious whole that's greater than the sum of its parts. This balance makes it a perfect example of how modern cocktails can achieve sophistication through careful ingredient selection.

## Enduring Appeal

The Paper Plane continues to delight drinkers with its sophisticated flavor profile and perfect balance. Whether enjoyed as an aperitif or a sophisticated evening cocktail, it serves as a reminder that the best modern cocktails often arise from careful attention to balance and harmony rather than complexity for its own sake. üçπ‚úàÔ∏èü•É
