## Origin

The Tom Collins owes its name to a bit of 19th-century mischief known as "The Great Tom Collins Hoax" of 1874³. The prank involved telling people that a man named Tom Collins was speaking ill of them, leading them on a wild goose chase to find this non-existent troublemaker. The cocktail itself predates the hoax, with roots possibly stretching back to a similar drink called the John Collins, named after a headwaiter at a London hotel in the 1860s.

## History

The first recorded recipe for the Tom Collins appears in the 1876 edition of Jerry Thomas' "The Bartender's Guide"³. Since then, it has become one of the most iconic and enduring cocktails, a staple of American mixology. The Tom Collins is often associated with the leisurely pace of summer socializing, offering a refreshing escape from the heat.

## Conclusion

The Tom Collins is more than just a cocktail; it's a symbol of summertime leisure and the art of relaxation. Whether enjoyed in the shade of a porch or by the poolside, the Tom Collins remains a timeless choice for those seeking refreshment and a touch of elegance.
