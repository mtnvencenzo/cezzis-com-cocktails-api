## Origin and Etymology

The Michelada's origins are a bit hazy, much like the drink itself. Here are two popular theories:

**General Michel's Influence**: Legend has it that during the Mexican Revolution, a general named **Augusto Michel** frequented a San Luis Potosi cantina. To lift his soldiers' spirits after combat, he ordered beer with lime, salt, ice, and a straw, served in a cup called a "chabela." Over time, this concoction became known as "Michel's lemonade," eventually shortening to **Michelada**. Other sauces were later added to the original recipe, resulting in the modern version.  

**"My Cold Beer"**: Another etymology suggests that **Michelada** is a portmanteau of **"mi chela helada"**, which translates to **"my ice-cold beer"** in Spanish. The word **"chela"** is slang for beer, and **"helada"** means cold. So, Michelada essentially means "my cold beer"!  

## Variations

- Some Michelada recipes include tomato juice or Clamato (a blend of clam and tomato juices) for a Bloody Mary-style twist with beer.
- In Mexico City, the Michelada is often made without tomato juice, relying on citrus, spices, and hot sauce for flavor.

Choose your favorite Mexican lager (such as Tecate, Sol, or Modelo Especial), rim the glass with a salt-cayenne mixture, and enjoy the savory-spicy flair of each sip. Salud! 🍺🌶️🍋
