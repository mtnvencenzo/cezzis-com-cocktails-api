## A Toast to History

The **French 75** is a cocktail that's as celebratory as it is storied, named after the quick-firing 75mm field gun used by the French army during World War I. The drink's combination of gin and Champagne packs a punch akin to the artillery piece it's named after.

## Origins and Evolution

The French 75 was created in 1915 at the New York Bar in Paris—later Harry's New York Bar—by barman Harry MacElhone. The original concoction was a mix of gin, Champagne, lemon juice, and sugar, said to have such a kick that it felt like being shelled with the powerful French 75mm field gun².

## A Symbol of Celebration

The French 75 became popular in America at the Stork Club in New York and has appeared in various films and literature, symbolizing celebration and sophistication. It's a drink that's perfect for toasts, special occasions, or any moment that calls for a bit of bubbly elegance².

Enjoy your French 75, a cocktail that's a blend of history, artistry, and the joy of celebration! 🥂✨
