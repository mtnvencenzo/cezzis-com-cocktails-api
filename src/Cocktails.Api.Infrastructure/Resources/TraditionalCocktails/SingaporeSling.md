## Origin

**Raffles Hotel**: Picture yourself in the early 20th century, lounging at the Long Bar of the iconic **Raffles Hotel** in Singapore. It's here that the Singapore Sling was born, crafted by bartender **Ngiam Tong Boon**. The year? Somewhere between 1910 and 1915.  

**A Twist on the Gin Sling**: The Singapore Sling is a delightful variation on the classic **Gin Sling**, a type of single-serving punch. Ngiam Tong Boon's creation combined gin with a medley of flavors, resulting in a drink that captured the essence of the tropics.  

## History

**Pink Perfection**: The original Singapore Sling was a delicate pink color, thanks to the blend of ingredients. It became a signature drink at the Raffles Hotel, enjoyed by travelers, expatriates, and adventurers alike.  

**Recipe Debates**: Over time, variations of the Singapore Sling emerged. The Raffles Hotel claims that the authentic recipe includes gin, cherry brandy (cherry liqueur), Cointreau, Bénédictine, pineapple juice, lime juice, grenadine, and bitters. However, other versions, like the one found in Harry Craddock's "The Savoy Cocktail Book," simplify it to gin, cherry brandy, lemon juice, and club soda.  

## Conclusion

The Singapore Sling is more than a drink; it's a passport to a bygone era. As you sip, imagine the whispers of palm fronds, the clinking of crystal, and the laughter of fellow travelers. Cheers to adventure, to history, and to the timeless allure of the Singapore Sling!
